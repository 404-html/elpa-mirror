** What is Exwm-X

Exwm-X is a derivative window manager based on EXWM (emacs x window manager),
which focus on Mouse-Control-People.

** Showcase
1. Tilling windows

2. Floating windows

   [[./snapshots/floating-window.png]]

** Feature
*** Appconfig
`exwmx-appconfig' is a database manager, which is used to record and manage
appconfigs (an appconfig is a plist of application's information), when run
command `exwmx-appconfig', a buffer with appconfig-template will be poped up,
user can edit the template and run `exwmx-appconfig-finish' to save the change
or run `exwmx-appconfig-ignore' to ignore the change.

All appconfigs will be saved into file: `exwmx-appconfig-file'.

By default, every appconfig have the following keys:

**** :command
Record the shell command of application.

**** :alias
Define alias of an application, this key is used by `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

**** :pretty-name
In EXWM and Exwm-X, an application is assocated with an emacs buffer,
user can set the buffer's name with :pretty-name.

**** :paste-key
Record the paste keybinding of an application, this key is used
by `exwmx-sendstring'.

**** :class
Record the application's class, this key is used by `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

**** :instance
Record the application's instance, this key is used by `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

**** :title
Record the application's title, this key is used by `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.


*** Buttons
Exwm-X add the following *buttons* to mode-line, user can
click them to operate application's window:

1. [X]: Delete the current application.
2. [D]: Delete the current emacs window.
3. [R]: Run `exwm-reset'.
4. [F]: Toggle floating/tilling window.
5. [<]: Move window border to left.
6. [+]: Maximize the current window.
7. [>]: Move window border to right.
8. [-]: Split window horizontal.
9. [|]: Split window vertical.
10. [_]: minumize floating application
11. [Z+]: Zoom+ floating application's window
12. [Z-]: Zoom- floating application's window
13. [Line 'XXXX']: toggle EXWM char-mode/line-mode

*** Move or resize a floating-window without press WIN key.
By default, EXWM use "s-'down-mouse-1'" to move a floating-window
and "s-'down-mouse-3'" to resize a floating-window.

When Exwm-X is enabled, user can drag *title showed in mode-line*
to move a floating-window. and click '[Z+]' and '[Z-]' in mode-line
to resize a floating-window.

*** Jump-or-exec
If the application's window is found, jump to this window, otherwise,
launch the application with command, this feature need appconfigs stored
in `exwmx-appconfig-file'.

**** The simplest usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(exwmx-jump-or-exec "firefox")
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Define an alias
Search an appconfig which :alias is "web-browser", and run this
appconfig's :command.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(exwmx-jump-or-exec "web-browser" nil t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Dynamic menu
`exwmx-dmenu' let user input a dmenu command in minibuffer,
and execute it, ivy is used to complete.

`exwmx-dmenu' support some command prefixes:
1. "," -> run a dmenu-command in terminal emulator, for example,
   dmenu-command ",top" will execute a terminal emulator, then run shell command: "top" .

   Note: user can change terminal emulator with the help of
   variable `exwmx-terminal-emulator'.
2. ";" -> run an emacs command which name is exwm:<input>, for example,
   dmenu-command ";firefox" will run emacs command exwm:firefox.
3. "-" -> split window top-to-bottom, for example,
   the result of dmenu-command "-32" is that 3 windows on top and 2 windows in buttom.
4. "|" -> split window left-to-right, for example,
   the result of dmenu-command "|32" is that 3 windows at left and 2 window at right

User can customize the prefixes of `exwmx-dmenu' with the help of
`exwmx-dmenu-prefix-setting'.

*** Send a string to application

When run `exwmx-sendstring', a buffer will be poped up to let user edit.
after run command `exwmx-sendstring-finish', the content of the buffer will
be sent to the input field of current application.

`exwmx-sendstring-from-minibuffer' is a simple version of `exwmx-sendstring',
it use minibuffer to get input.

`exwmx-sendstring-from-kill-ring' can select a string in kill-ring then send
this string to application.

NOTE: if `exwmx-sendstring' can not work well with an application, user
should set :paste-key of this application with the help of `exwmx-appconfig'.

** Install
1. Config melpa repository, please seeï¼šhttp://melpa.org/#/getting-started
2. M-x package-install RET exwm-x RET

** Configure

*** Add exwm-x directory to emacs's load-path
Pasting the below line to "~/.emacs" is a simple way.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/exwm-x")
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file
You should edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file like below example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

# Fallback cursor
# xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr

# Keyboard repeat rate
# xset r rate 200 60

xhost +SI:localuser:$USER

exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs --eval '(require (quote exwmx-loader))'
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Make "~/.initrc" or "~/.xsession" excutable

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
chmod a+x ~/.xsession
#+END_EXAMPLE

or

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
chmod a+x ~/.initrc
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Edit "~/.exwm-x"
Add your exwm config to this file, for example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'exwm)
(require 'exwm-x)
(require 'exwmx-xfce)
(require 'exwmx-example)
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t v") 'exwmx:file-browser)
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t f") 'exwmx:web-browser)
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t c") 'exwmx-xfce-terminal)
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t C-c") 'exwmx-xfce-new-terminal)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage
*** Build appconfig database
When user *first* login in Exwm-X desktop environment,
appconfigs of frequently used applications should be added
to appconfig database file: `exwmx-appconfig-file',
it is simple but *very very* important, for many useful commands
of Exwm-X need this database file, for example:
`exwmx-jump-or-exec', `exwmx-sendstring' and so on.

user should do like the below:

1. Launch an application with `exwmx-dmenu'.
2. Run command `exwmx-appconfig'.
3. Edit appconfig template
4. Save
5. Launch another application with `exwmx-dmenu'.
6. .......


*** The usage of "exwmx-example"
"exwmx-example" is Exwm-X buildin example, user can use it to
test Exwm-X's features, the following is its keybindings.
by the way, Exwm-X is a Exwm derivative, most Exwm commands
can be used too :-)

| Key       | command                         |
|-----------+---------------------------------|
| "C-t ;"   | exwmx-dmenu                     |
| "C-t C-e" | exwmx-sendstring                |
| "C-t C-r" | exwmx-appconfig                 |
| "C-t 1"   | exwmx-switch-to-1-workspace     |
| "C-t 2"   | exwmx-switch-to-2-workspace     |
| "C-t 3"   | exwmx-switch-to-3-workspace     |
| "C-t 4"   | exwmx-switch-to-4-workspace     |
| "C-x o"   | switch-window                   |
| "C-c y"   | exwmx-sendstring-from-kill-ring |

If exwmx-example doesn't suit for your need, just copy and paste
its useful pieces to your "~/.exwm-x" file.
