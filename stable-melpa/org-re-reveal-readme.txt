This package provides Org export functionality to generate HTML
presentations with the presentation framework reveal.js.
It grew out of a forked version of org-reveal whose development
seems to have stalled and which cannot be installed with recent
versions of Org mode any more:
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/issues/342
I tried to contribute to org-reveal but did not receive a response
from the maintainer:
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/issues/349
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/pull/277

See "Readme.org" for introduction and details.
